University Admit Eligibility Predictor


UNIVERSITY ADMIT ELIGIBILITY PREDICTOR predicts the admission of a student based on different features
including university rating, studentâ€™s undergraduate GPA, GRE score, research experience and etc. This
predicts that how much chances are there that the student will get admission in his selected university or
not.

In this project I have used multiple algorithms and completed building of a regression model to predict the 
chance of admission into a particular university based on the student's profile and deploy it in IBM
